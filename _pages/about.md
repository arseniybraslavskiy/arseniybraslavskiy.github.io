## Welcome!

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the University of Maryland, currently on the job market (2025â€“26).

I am a public finance economist specializing in intergovernmental relations and the challenges of policy implementation. My research uses applied microeconometric methods to examine the complex and sometimes unintended consequences of government action.
